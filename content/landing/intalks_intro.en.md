Over the past five quarters, Industry Talk has focused on operations research application scenarios such as intelligent decision-making, energy, and finance. We have invited heavyweight guests from startups to industry leaders to present the latest developments in these sectors. These discussions not only analyzed the core challenges faced by various industries but also showcased the crucial role and development trends of operations research in these fields.

In the future, we will continue to explore more industry themes and encourage everyone to put forward valuable opinions and suggestions to jointly promote the development and progress of the industry.
