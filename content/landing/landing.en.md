## OR Talk
### Delving into Academia: Sparking Inspiration (Bi-monthly)
OR Talk is dedicated to providing in-depth interpretations and wide-ranging promotion of academic achievements. We invite expert guests to share their latest scholarly accomplishments or to conduct thorough analyses and discussions of classic and trending topics. Through these fascinating presentations and open discussions, OR Talk aims to unveil the trends in technological development, analyze the core challenges faced, and bring about a profound brainstorming experience for all participants.

Moreover, through community interactions and exchanges, participants can not only meet like-minded friends but also collectively "level up" on their academic exploration journey.


## Tech Talk
### Technological Practice: Insights into the Future (Bi-monthly)
Tech Talk focuses on the application of academic achievements in real-world scenarios. In each issue, we invite industry experts to share their experiences and insights on successfully applying technological theories to practical problems. Through sharing and Q&A sessions, the entire process from "problem discovery - research exploration - practical application" is presented, guiding participants to gain an in-depth understanding of the stories behind technological practices and providing guidance for technological exploration in specific domains.

## In Talk
### Industry Analysis: Leading the Trends (Quarterly)
Over the past five quarters, Industry Talk has focused on operations research application scenarios such as intelligent decision-making, energy, and finance. We have invited heavyweight guests from startups to industry leaders to present the latest developments in these sectors. These discussions not only analyzed the core challenges faced by various industries but also showcased the crucial role and development trends of operations research in these fields.

In the future, we will continue to explore more industry themes and encourage everyone to put forward valuable opinions and suggestions to jointly promote the development and progress of the industry.


## OR Meet & Greet
### Life Experiences, Wisdom Sharing (Held Irregularly)

OR Living Room is a live streaming series focusing on sharing personal experiences and life wisdom. We invite renowned individuals from both industry and academia, as well as approachable and friendly senior students, to engage in deep conversations with the audience. They will share their learning and career experiences, insights on applying for overseas studies, strategies for postgraduate and doctoral entrance exams, and their expertise in publishing academic papers. Through these sharing sessions, participants have the opportunity to "replicate" the successful trajectories of the guests and draw valuable inspiration and guidance.

The unique aspect of this live streaming series is that we (try to) avoid discussing academic issues and (try to) refrain from delving into technical details. Instead, we focus on sharing personal experiences and life wisdom. Here, we encourage open-ended voice communication, allowing every participant to gain enlightenment and growth in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.
