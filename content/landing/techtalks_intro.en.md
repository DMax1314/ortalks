Tech Talk focuses on the application of academic achievements in real-world scenarios. In each issue, we invite industry experts to share their experiences and insights on successfully applying technological theories to practical problems. Through sharing and Q&A sessions, the entire process from "problem discovery - research exploration - practical application" is presented, guiding participants to gain an in-depth understanding of the stories behind technological practices and providing guidance for technological exploration in specific domains.
