OR Talk is dedicated to providing in-depth interpretations and wide-ranging promotion of academic achievements. We invite expert guests to share their latest scholarly accomplishments or to conduct thorough analyses and discussions of classic and trending topics. Through these fascinating presentations and open discussions, OR Talk aims to unveil the trends in technological development, analyze the core challenges faced, and bring about a profound brainstorming experience for all participants.

Moreover, through community interactions and exchanges, participants can not only meet like-minded friends but also collectively "level up" on their academic exploration journey.
