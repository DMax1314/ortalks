### Review 
- Dichotomy between posture of the Assyrians and subjugated peoples
  - Assyrians are upright; foreigners are often hunched / subservient to the king
- Posture/gesture of the people when addressing the king (Portuese)
  - more extreme postures e.g. kissing the floor in front of the king
  - Proably symbolic - there needed to be a safe distance between anyone and the king
  - Safety measures: visitors had to be led by palace officials (rab ekalli, palace manager); they are first led to the back central courtyard -> secondary throne room
    - Honored, esteemed guests
      - See reliefs of tributaries in procession
    - Those who need to “have the fear put into them” 
      - See reliefs of torture, captives
  - What guests have to do before seeing the king
    - Cleaning, ritual cleansing, perfuming, posturing deferentially
