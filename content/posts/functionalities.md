### The Black Obelisk
- Unlike other artifacts, it’s not palace-centric
  - Not found within palace walls; on the high citadel of Nimrud
  - is **public**
  - Maybe aspirational, but definitely instructive
- Content
  - Tributaries carrying miniature “models” of other cities in Assyria
    - Be able to show guests
    - Highlight ownership & control
    - Give the kings a lens to a wider world (often times they don’t get to see the cities they conquer)
- Thronebase from Shalmaneser in Nimrud
