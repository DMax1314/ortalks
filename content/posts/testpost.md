### Space representation in reliefs (military campaigns)
- Ashurnasirpal’s throne room
  - worms eye perspective
- Tiglath-Pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib
  - Restricted perspective breaks down, shifts into more relaxed perspective
- Ashurbanipal
  - Redecorating Sennacherib’s palace
  - Went back to registers (but in a weird way) - playful?
    - e.g. Instead of standard inscriptions in between registers, there is a river - bird’s eye view?
  - Use of empty space
    - Emotional & charged empty spaces?
    - Some are confusing & inexplicable (looks unnecessary)?
      - Proposition: to draw attention, to separate different groups, etc
