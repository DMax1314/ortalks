DQ outperforms traditional estimators in bias-variance trade-off, reducing bias and exponentially decreasing variance. Collaborating with ByteDance, DQ achieved a 99% reduction in mean squared error in large-scale commercial scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Lenovo: Practical Application of Operations Research in Material Requirement Planning within Lenovo's Supply Chain｜InTalk 0503</title><link>http://localhost:1313/en/intalks/intalk_0503/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 21:01:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/en/intalks/intalk_0503/</guid><description>This lecture will introduce Material Requirement Planning (MRP), explaining its fundamental concepts and significance.

Finally, the lecture will present Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s MRP system based on intelligent decision-making technology, highlighting its unique advantages in improving efficiency and optimizing resource management.</description></item><item><title>OR Talk 41: A Route Network Planning Method for Urban Air Delivery</title><link>http://localhost:1313/en/ortalks/ortalk_22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 21:01:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/en/ortalks/ortalk_22/</guid><description>High-tech companies are investing in drone technologies for urban air delivery to address last-mile delivery issues and reduce road traffic congestion. Effective traffic management is crucial for scaling up these services in dense urban environments. This paper introduces a tube-based ConOps route network planning method, which decouples the NP-hard network planning problem into single-path problems and uses a space cost function for dense route design. Tests show this method generates near-optimal routes with significant computational time savings.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to OR AI China</title><link>http://localhost:1313/en/landing/landing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:43:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/en/landing/landing/</guid><description>Bridge the chasm between academia and industry &amp;amp; span the gulf between theory and practice.</description></item><item><title>OR Talk: Sparking Academic Inspirations</title><link>http://localhost:1313/en/landing/ortalks_intro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:51:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/en/landing/ortalks_intro/</guid><description>Held bi-monthly, OR Talk is dedicated to providing in-depth interpretations and wide-ranging promotion of academic achievements.
