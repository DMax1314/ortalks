Wagner实践卓越奖，Applied Probability Society Best Student Prize，RMP Jeff McGill Student Paper Award，和MSOM Best Student Prize Finalist。\n分享内容： 以上是我们对本次直播展示 PPT 的部分截取。 关注下方公众号，后台回复关键词 TechTalk，可获取本期录播和 PPT 的完整内容。\n观众提问： 一 Q: A/B测试是否可以扩展到A/B/C/D等多组场景？ A: 可以。方法论上具有很强的可扩展性，但是需要修改相应的数学描述。\n二 Q: A/A测试中的两个A是指不同版本间的比较吗？ A: 不是，A/A测试是对于同一个算法的分流测试。在这种情况下，真实的treatment effect是0。它一般用于检查estimator的鲁棒性或者估计estimator的方差。A/A测试可以对用户分成两组测试，有时也会分成两个时间段测试。\n三 Q: 关于DQ方法的灵感/直觉来源什么？ A: 从RL的角度来看，interference的产生主要是由于当下的action会影响到未来的reward。所以我们消除interference的方法就采用了未来的reward总和（也就是Q-value）来代替当下的reward去计算两组实验的差值。我们在抖音场景下举了两个例子来进一步阐释，具体内容欢迎观看video或者阅读论文。 \u0026hellip; 详细解答以及大量关于 A/B测试/强化学习/Interference 的应用讨论（“坑”）请移步B站录播视频，自行食用。 相关资料：\nFarias, Vivek, Andrew Li, Tianyi Peng, and Andrew Zheng. \u0026ldquo;Markovian interference in experiments.\u0026rdquo; Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 535-549.
